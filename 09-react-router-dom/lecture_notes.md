## Adding Routes with react-router-dom

AGENDA:
6:00-6:30pm - discuss useState scope variables and closures (and garbage collection). 
[Namaste JS Guy - Akshay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pN6jk0uUrD8)

6:30 7:00pm - initial discussion of react-router dom, what is client side routing, how we use react-router-dom to mimic client/server routing (via conditional component rendering and url changes)

7:00 - 7:10pm - BREAK

7:10 - 8:10pm - planning our routes and RESTful routing. Install and start using our r-r-d components

8:10-8:20pm - BREAK

8:20 - 9:00pm - continue implementing our r-r-d tools, including Link/NavLink and useParams and useHistory hooks

anything we haven't completed refactoring together, I'd like you to look at on your own. if something doesn't behave as you expect, use your newfound knowledge to fix any bugs you may find with regard to routing/routes.
